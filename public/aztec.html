    <p style="font-size: 1.4rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px;">
The Aztec economy was based on agriculture, tribute, and trade. They used chinampas — floating gardens — to grow crops like maize, beans, and squash, which supported large cities. Conquered regions paid tribute in goods such as food, textiles, and feathers, which helped sustain the empire and its rulers.    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.4rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px;">
Markets played a major role, with merchants trading everyday items and luxury goods. Cacao beans and cotton cloth were used as currency, and long-distance traders called Pochteca brought rare items from distant lands. Trade routes and roads kept the empire connected and thriving.

    <h2 style="color: #d4af37; font-size: 3rem; margin-bottom: 30px;">Taxes and Labor in Aztec Society</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.3rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px;">
Taxes and labor were pillars of the Aztec imperial system. Instead of paying in money, commoners contributed through goods and services. Most citizens, especially farmers, paid taxes in the form of food (like maize), textiles, tools, and other local products. These tributes were collected by appointed officials and sent to the capital, Tenochtitlán, where they supported the nobility, priesthood, military, and the emperor’s court. Each region had specific quotas, and failure to comply could lead to harsh punishments.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.3rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px;">
In addition to material tributes, labor was a form of tax. Citizens were often required to participate in state-sponsored projects such as temple construction, road maintenance, and agricultural infrastructure. This system, known as tequio, was a communal obligation rather than slavery. However, actual slavery did exist—often as a result of debt, punishment, or war capture—but enslaved people still retained certain rights and could regain freedom. The combination of labor and tribute ensured that the empire functioned smoothly and remained well-resourced.
